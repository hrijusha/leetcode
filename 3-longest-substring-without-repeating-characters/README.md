<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters">Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /><hr><p>Given a string <code>s</code>, find the length of the <strong>longest</strong> <span data-keyword="substring-nonempty"><strong>substring</strong></span> without duplicate characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abcabcbb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;abc&quot;, with the length of 3. Note that <code>&quot;bca&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;cab&quot;</code> are also correct answers.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;bbbbb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;b&quot;, with the length of 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;pwwkew&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is &quot;wke&quot;, with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, &quot;pwke&quot; is a subsequence and not a substring.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.</li>
</ul>

## 💡 Approach 1: Sliding Window using HashSet (Standard)

This approach uses the **Sliding Window** technique with two pointers (`left` and `right`) and a `HashSet`. 

We expand our window by moving the `right` pointer and adding characters to the set. If we encounter a character that is already in the set, we shrink the window from the `left` by removing characters from the set until the duplicate is gone. We continuously track the maximum window size.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis
* **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` in average cases (technically `O(2N)` worst case as each character might be visited by both pointers).
* **Space Complexity:** `O(K)` where `K` is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for English letters or 128 for ASCII).
